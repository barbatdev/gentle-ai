### SDD Session Preflight (HARD GATE)

Before executing ANY SDD command or natural-language SDD request, ensure this session has an explicit `SDD Session Preflight` decision block.

This applies to `/sdd-new`, `/sdd-ff`, `/sdd-continue`, `/sdd-explore`, `/sdd-status`, `/sdd-apply`, `/sdd-verify`, `/sdd-archive`, and natural-language equivalents such as "use SDD to add dark mode" / "do it with SDD".

Required preflight choices:

1. **Execution mode**: `interactive` or `auto`.
2. **Artifact store**: `openspec`, `engram`, or `both` when Engram is callable. If Engram is unavailable, offer only file/inline-safe choices.
3. **Chained PR strategy**: the canonical `delivery_strategy` — `ask-on-risk`, `auto-chain`, `single-pr`, or `exception-ok`. The preflight menu offers the first three; `exception-ok` is reachable only when the user explicitly accepts `size:exception`.
4. **Review budget**: maximum changed lines before stopping for reviewer-burden approval.

User-facing preflight question format:

Use the `question` tool for SDD Session Preflight only when it is available in the current interactive runtime and all four groups are exactly representable. While that native route is usable, do NOT render a duplicate plain-chat menu. If the tool is unavailable, denied, the runtime is noninteractive, or the prompt is unrepresentable, follow the Lossless Blocking Prompts fallback above and STOP.

When the native route is representable, ask all four preflight groups in one single `question` tool call so OpenCode can render the groups as tabs. Do NOT run this as a sequential wizard. Do NOT issue four separate `question` tool calls.

The single `question` tool call must contain these four localized groups in this order:

1. Pace: Interactive, Automatic.
2. Artifacts: OpenSpec, Engram, Both.
3. PRs: Ask me, Single PR, Auto.
4. Review: 400 lines, 800 lines, Other.

Match the user's current language and active persona for question labels and descriptions. Treat the preflight UI as direct orchestrator conversation, not as a generated technical artifact. Technical artifacts still default to English, but this UI follows the user's conversation language/persona. Do NOT mix languages inside one grouped question.

Do NOT show option codes in the interactive UI. Do NOT show canonical values or other internal values in the interactive UI labels or descriptions.

After the single grouped `question` tool call returns, map the selected human labels to canonical values internally. Do not reveal the canonical values in the UI.

If Other is selected for review budget, ask one follow-up question for the numeric budget.

Only after all four preflight choices are collected, summarize them as the `SDD Session Preflight` decision block and continue with the SDD init guard/requested phase.

Map answers to canonical values:

- Pace: Interactive -> `interactive`; Automatic -> `auto`.
- Artifacts: OpenSpec -> `openspec`; Engram -> `engram`; Both -> `both`.
- PRs: Ask me -> `ask-on-risk`; Single PR -> `single-pr`; Auto -> `auto-chain`.
- Review: 400 lines -> `review_budget_lines: 400`; 800 lines -> `review_budget_lines: 800`; Other -> ask one follow-up for the number.

The PR canonical values are exactly the `delivery_strategy` domain `sdd-tasks` and `sdd-apply` accept; never emit a value outside it. The preflight offers no separate chained option because `delivery_strategy` is only consulted once the tasks forecast flags review-budget risk: below that line there is nothing to chain, and above it `Auto` already resolves to `auto-chain` without asking again.

Hard gate rules:

- `openspec/config.yaml`, existing SDD artifacts, previous `sdd-init` results, or installed SDD assets do NOT satisfy session preflight.
- If the session has no preflight block, ask the single grouped `question` tool preflight above. Do not run init, delegate phases, edit files, or apply tasks until all four choices are collected.
- Cache the choices for this session and include them in later phase prompts.
- If the user explicitly provided all four choices in the current conversation, summarize them as the session preflight block and continue.

### Delivery Strategy

This is collected by `SDD Session Preflight` as the chained PR strategy. If missing, enforce the hard gate before any phase work. Ask which delivery/review strategy they want:

- **`ask-on-risk`** (default): Ask later if `sdd-tasks` forecasts high risk or >400 changed lines.
- **`auto-chain`**: If forecast is high, continue with chained/stacked PR slices without asking again.
- **`single-pr`**: Prefer one PR; if forecast exceeds 400 lines, require `size:exception` before apply.
- **`exception-ok`**: Allow a large PR because the maintainer explicitly accepts `size:exception`. The preflight menu cannot select this; it is reached only when the user explicitly accepts `size:exception`, either up front or when `ask-on-risk` stops to ask.

These four are the whole domain. Cache the delivery strategy for the session. Pass it as `delivery_strategy` to `sdd-tasks` and `sdd-apply` prompts.

### Chain Strategy

When `delivery_strategy` results in chained PRs (either by user choice via `ask-on-risk` or automatically via `auto-chain`), ask the user which chain strategy to use. Present the two strategy options through one `question` tool call when the lossless native route is usable; otherwise emit the complete choice through the plain chat or terminal fallback and STOP.

- **`stacked-to-main`**: Each PR merges to main in order. Fast iteration, fix on the go. Best for speed-first teams and independent slices.
- **`feature-branch-chain`**: The feature/tracker branch accumulates final integration; PR #1 targets the tracker branch, later child PRs target the immediate previous PR branch so review diffs stay focused. Only the tracker merges to main. Best for rollback control and coordinated releases.

Cache the chain strategy for the session. Pass it as `chain_strategy` to `sdd-tasks` and `sdd-apply` prompts alongside `delivery_strategy`. Do not ask again unless the user changes scope.

When delivery planning yields chained PRs, treat `chained-pr` (registry skill `gentle-ai-chained-pr`) as a required skill match: resolve it by registry name through this template's existing skill-resolution mechanism (the same one it already uses to pass skills to phases) and ensure the `sdd-tasks` and `sdd-apply` phases load and follow it BEFORE planning or creating any PR. Do not hardcode the skill path; defer resolution to that mechanism.

### Review Workload Guard (MANDATORY)

After `sdd-tasks` completes and before launching `sdd-apply`, inspect the task result summary for `Review Workload Forecast`.

If it says `Chained PRs recommended: Yes`, `400-line budget risk: High`, estimated changed lines exceed 400, or `Decision needed before apply: Yes`, apply the cached `delivery_strategy`. Whenever a directive below tells the orchestrator to ask the user a decision (split vs. exception, or which chain strategy), use one `question` tool call only when the complete decision is natively representable; otherwise emit the complete choice through the plain chat or terminal fallback and STOP.

- **`ask-on-risk`**: STOP and ask whether to split into chained/stacked PRs or proceed with `size:exception`, using the lossless blocking-prompt route. If the user chooses chained PRs and `chain_strategy` is not yet cached, ask which chain strategy to use (stacked-to-main or feature-branch-chain) through the same route.
- **`auto-chain`**: Do not ask about splitting. If `chain_strategy` is not yet cached, ask which chain strategy to use through the lossless blocking-prompt route. Then pass to `sdd-apply`: implement only the next autonomous slice using work-unit commits, with clear start, finish, verification, and rollback boundary.
- **`single-pr`**: STOP and require/record maintainer-approved `size:exception` before `sdd-apply`.
- **`exception-ok`**: Continue, but pass to `sdd-apply` that this run uses maintainer-approved `size:exception`.

Any other `delivery_strategy` value is invalid. Do NOT pick the nearest branch and do NOT proceed: STOP, report the unrecognised value, and re-collect the delivery strategy through the lossless blocking-prompt route before launching `sdd-apply`.

Do this even in Automatic mode. Automatic mode does not override reviewer burnout protection.

When launching `sdd-apply`, always include the resolved `delivery_strategy`, `chain_strategy`, and any chosen PR boundary/exception in the prompt.

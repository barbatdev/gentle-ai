## Activation Contract

Load when a planned PR may exceed **400 changed lines**, SDD forecasts chain risk, or the user asks for chained/stacked PRs, review slices, or reviewer-load control.

## Hard Rules

- Detect the Git host read-only; stop when it is unknown or ambiguous.
- Use the GitHub native route only when #3356 proves the exact host/build capability; do not silently install it or fall back to manual GitHub choreography, and never permit `size:exception` there.
- A positively identified non-GitHub host uses its host-specific adapter and portable chaining; a maintainer-approved `size:exception` is available only there, and parent closure requires the reference's fail-closed invariant: no dependent child may remain.
- Issue approval, planning, SDD phase approval, `auto-chain`, RDD reviews/receipts, and delivery approval do not authorize remote create/submit/sync/update/merge operations; each consumes separate bounded authority.
- Compose Chain Context into generated `pr-body.md`; never modify the target repository's PR template.
- Use `Refs #<parent>` only as a visible non-closing link on intermediate slices; GitHub does not treat it as closure. Only a terminal scope-closing PR may use a closing keyword. Partial or abandoned chains leave the parent open, and reduced scope requires an explicit maintainer decision before closure.

## Decision Gates

| Condition | Action |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub plus #3356 exact host/build proof | Use only the proven native command help surface. |
| GitHub without that proof | Fail-closed; provide the official setup and evidence guidance in the reference. |
| Positively identified non-GitHub host | Select the portable strategy explicitly. |
| Unknown or ambiguous host | Fail-closed; run `git remote get-url --all origin` to resolve or prove ambiguity, then select the route. |
| Over-budget `single-pr` on GitHub | Stop; run the exact-base check below, then select `auto-chain` or reduce scope; never use `size:exception`. |
| Over-budget `ask-on-risk` or `auto-chain` | Select or form a compliant chain; this is not remote authority. |

```bash
pr_number="${1:?PR number required}"; case "$pr_number" in ''|0*|*[!0-9]*) printf '%s\n' 'PR number must be a positive integer' >&2; exit 2;; esac
pr_id="$(gh pr view "$pr_number" --json id --jq .id)"
IFS=$'\t' read -r base_oid base_repo < <(gh api graphql -f query='query($id: ID!) { node(id: $id) { ... on PullRequest { baseRefOid baseRepository { nameWithOwner } } } }' -F id="$pr_id" --jq '[.data.node.baseRefOid, .data.node.baseRepository.nameWithOwner] | @tsv')
test -n "$base_oid" && test -n "$base_repo" && { git cat-file -e "$base_oid^{commit}" 2>/dev/null || git fetch --no-tags --no-write-fetch-head "https://github.com/$base_repo.git" "$base_oid"; } && git cat-file -e "$base_oid^{commit}" && (set -o pipefail; git diff --numstat "$base_oid" HEAD | awk -F '\t' '$1 !~ /^[0-9]+$/ || $2 !~ /^[0-9]+$/ { bad=1; next } { total += $1 + $2 } END { exit bad || total > 400 }')
```

## Execution Steps

1. Detect the host and select GitHub native or portable routing.
2. Apply `ask-on-risk`, `auto-chain`, or `single-pr`; retain `feature-branch-chain` for portable routing.
3. Partition autonomous work units under budget, compose `pr-body.md` with Chain Context, and require separate bounded authority before every remote operation.
4. After a sync, rebase, or base change, re-enter through review status; with RDD disabled, follow ordinary repository policy and report `disabled/unmanaged`.

## Output Contract

Return provider, route, capability evidence, strategy, PR order, current boundary, dependency diagram, budget, verification plan, remote-authority status, and any portable `size:exception` rationale.
